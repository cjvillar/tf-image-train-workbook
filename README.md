# Understanding TensorFlow with Image Detection

Here I'm trying to understand the process of image/obj detection with TensoreFlow
by attempting to train a model step by step in a jyupiter Notebook.

This repo is a Work In Progress. 

## Steps:
1. gather data image_scrape_code
2. run notebook tf_image.ipynb



## START
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
